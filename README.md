Hello everyon! This is the sharing of the
printer by connecting both a USB and LAN cable
(critical situation)

************
It all started with a driver compatibility issue.
The host computer was running Windows 10, and the
plug-in computer was running Windows 7. The conflict
was at the driver level and gave the error 0x0000011b.
I tried to run the printer through a virtual machine,
but on computer, it initialized incorrectly in it,
which caused the installation to crash, and on the
other, it was just extremely weak, and the printer was
very needed.
âœ“ Decision:
Insert the LAN cable into the printer by connecting
the other end to the system adapted. At the same time,
if a network is meant on the computer, then connect the
main network cable to the network card. Restart network
services in the printer and it will give you an IP adress.
Then find it by installing drivers at the IP adress/device
name.
